Basic Arithmetic Operations <br>
Python supports all basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. <br>

<br>
Loops<br>
Python provides several loop constructs, including for and while loops.<br>

<br>

Lists<br>
Lists are versatile data structures in Python. You can create, access, and manipulate lists easily. <br>

<br>

Conditional Statements<br>
Conditional statements like if, else, and elif help control the flow of the program based on certain conditions<br>

<br>

Functions<br>
Functions allow you to group code that gets executed multiple times.<br>

MySQL Connection<br>
Python provides libraries like mysql-connector to connect to MySQL databases. Ensure you have it installed (pip install mysql-connector)<br>
